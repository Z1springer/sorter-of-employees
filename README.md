# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a employee directory with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

Given a table of random users generated from the [Random User API](https://randomuser.me/), when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.

The user should be able to:

- Sort the table by at least one category

- Filter the users by at least one property.

## Commit Early and Often

One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

1. Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills

2. Your commit history allows you to revert your code base in the event that you need to return to a previous state

Follow these guidelines for committing:

- Make single purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits

- Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history

- Don't commit half done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!)

- Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process

- We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!

- Deploy this site to GitHub Pages using the [Create React App docs for deployment.](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/deployment/#github-pages)

- **Important**: Be sure to push your codebase to GitHub and **NOT** your built and deployed code. Ensure this happens by following the above instructions and using the `gh-pages` branch to host the deployed application's code.

## Submission on BCS

You are required to submit the following:

- the URL to the deployed application

- the URL to the Github repository

## Notes from Joes' Demo

series of react componants that generates a list of employees, sort them alphabetically both asc and desc

~ random userAPI needed
~ controlled form inputs are controlled ONLY by react, you are always using these, no real use-case for the alternative

Denis' Deploying a react app Demo

~ Create a new repo (no readme or any of that jazz)
~ want to take the code in react and put it into the new repo
~ git remote add origin _repo link_
~ git branch -M main
~ git push origin main
~ heroku login (better safe than sorry)
~ heroku create _app-name_ --buildpack mars/create-react-app(github rec. by the teaching staff, search for _create-react-app mars_)
~ push to heroku main (make sure you have pushed everything to the repo before heroku)
~ job done

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
